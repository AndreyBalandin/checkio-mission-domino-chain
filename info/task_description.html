<p>
    You have a Domino box. Domino tiles contain two numbers from 0 (empty) to 6. Tiles are unordered and 1-6 is the same as 6-1. The double-six set contains 28 unique tiles - all combinations of number pairs.
</p>

<p>
    Several tiles fell out of the box. You should try to collect a chain from these tiles, making them to each other suitable sides (sides with the same numbers). Thus, you can get a continuous chain of all tiles. In some cases, such a chain will not be the only one.
</p>

<p>
    For example, you have got these tiles:<br>
    <strong>1-5, 2-5, 3-5, 4-5, 3-4</strong><br>
    Then you can build two complete chains:<br>
    <strong>1-5, 5-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-2</strong><br>
    <strong>1-5, 5-4, 4-3, 3-5, 5-2</strong><br>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Your goal in this mission</strong> is to count how many complete chains you can make using all the given dominoes.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note.</strong> Chains must be unique. An inverted chain is not considered as unique: "1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5" and "5-4, 4-3, 3-2, 2-1" are the same chain.
</p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong>
    String, describing the dominoes. Like this one: "5-4, 4-3, 3-2, 2-1".
</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong>
    Integer. The maximum number of complete chains that you can build using all the given tiles.

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    This is a combinatorial problem. You can solve it by modeling a real game with dominoes. Or refresh your knowledge of graph theory. Many things in life are like forming a chain of dominoes: for example, flights between several cities.
</p>

<p><strong>Precondition:</strong>
    5 <= len(given_tiles) <= 17
